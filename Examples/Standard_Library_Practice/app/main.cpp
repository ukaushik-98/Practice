// Code Example
//
// This code example takes you through a few uses of the "std::vector"
// container, including how it interfaces with iterators and generic
// algorithms.  The example is organized as a set of separate, unrelated
// functions, each demonstrating some aspect of this portion of the standard
// library.  The main() function is set up to call each of these functions,
// though I've commented all of the calls out; if you'd like to see the
// output of one of the functions in particular, uncomment the call to that
// function, then recompile and run the program.
//
// Be sure to read through the page on the course web site that discusses
// the background information for this code example before reading through
// this; it discusses the underlying concepts at work here, which I'll assume
// you're already familiar with in the comments here.

void accessingAndManipulatingVectorElements()
{
    // "std::vector" is a class template in C++, which means that it's necessary
    // to give it "type parameters".  There is no such thing, technically, as
    // a vector; there is only a std::vector<int>, a std::vector<string>, and so on.
    std::vector<int> v;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        // The push_back() function adds an element to the end of a vector.
        // push_back seems like a peculiar name, but it makes more sense when
        // you consider that you can remove the last element with a function
        // called pop_back (and that there are other containers with push_front
        // and pop_front functions, though vector lacks them, because they
        // would be inefficient).  You may recognize the terms "push" and "pop"
        // if you've previously learned about a classic data structure called
        // a stack.
        v.push_back(i);
    }


    // Another way to create the same vector -- since we've got a statically-
    // determined set of values to add to it (i.e., we know at compile time
    // exactly how many values to add and exactly what they are) -- is to use
    // the "initializer" syntax to initialize the vector instead.
    //
    // std::vector<int> v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    //
    // The "initializer" syntax uses curly braces instead of parentheses as a
    // means of listing what otherwise appear to be constructor parameters.
    // Some types, like std::vector<int>, support this syntax as a way of
    // passing an arbitrary number of values into the constructor and using
    // them to initialize what's stored inside of the object.
    //
    // (There's more to say about this initialization syntax, but we'll leave
    // the rest of it for another time.)


    // One way to access elements in a vector is to use the [] notation, which
    // is similar to how you access array elements in C++.  The feature of C++
    // that makes this possible is operator overloading, which we'll see in a
    // couple of weeks.  In this case, the [] operator has been overloaded to
    // work on vectors by returning a reference to the element at a particular
    // index.
    //
    // One thing to note about the [] operator on a vector is that it does not
    // perform range checking, which meas you can use it to access non-existent
    // cells, which will provide you with direct access to memory that quite
    // likely does not belong to the vector at all.  A separate function called
    // at() can be called on the vector instead, if you want range-checked
    // access to a cell.  at() can be used on either side of an assignment
    // statement, as demonstrated below, because it returns a reference to the
    // appropriate cell.  When at() accesses a cell out of bounds, it responds
    // by "throwing an exception", a mechanism we'll see in some detail toward
    // the end of the quarter.
    //
    // Like the elements of arrays, vector elements are indexed consecutively,
    // beginning at zero.  If there are n elements stored in the vecotr, their
    // indices will range from 0 through n - 1.  The size() function is a way
    // to ask a vector how many elements it stores.  The function returns a
    // size_t, which is an unsigned integral value.  So we'll want to use
    // either size_t or unsigned int in our loop, to avoid the potential of
    // "i < v.size()" generating a "signed/unsigned mismatch" warning.

    for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)
    {
        v[i] = v[i] * 2;
        v.at(i) = v.at(i) + 1;

        std::cout << v[i] << std::endl;
        std::cout << v.at(i) << std::endl;

    // You can also pass a parameter to the construtor, which immediately
    // sets the size of the vector to something other than zero.  The

    // Another way to iterate across a vector -- or any of the other containers
    // in the standard library -- is to use an iterator.  Iterators abstract
    // away the details of how elements are organized in a data structure,
    // providing instead of a uniform interface that allows you to iterate
    // different data structures with the same code.  This is the key to
    // implementing generic algorithms, like the ones that are written in the
    // standard library.
    //
    // An iterator has a "position", which indciates where in the data structure
    // the iterator refers to.  If there are n elements in a container, there are
    // n + 1 possible iterator positions: one for each element, and an extra one
    // called "end" that indicates a position just beyond the last element.  The
    // position called "begin" indicates the first element.  To get an iterator
    // into a container, we can call functions begin() and end() on it, which
    // return iterators in the "begin" and "end" positions, respectively.
    //
    // Iterators behave somewhat like pointers.  We can use the * (dereference)
    // operator to access or modify the element referred to by an iterator.  We
    // can use ++ to move it forward, -- to move it backward, += or -= to move
    // it forward or backward in more than just single steps, and so on, though
    // not all containers provide iterators that support all of these
    // operations.
    //
    // Here is an example of a loop that iterates through the vector v and does
    // two things:
    //   (1) Update the element so that it has "!!!" concatenated to it
    //   (2) Print the newly-updated element, followed by its length


    // std::vector<string>::iterator is an iterator that knows how to iterate
    // through a vector of strings.
    for (std::vector<std::string>::iterator i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); i++)
    {
        // Note that, since our iterator is called i, *i is the syntax for
        // accessing/changing the value referred to by the iterator.  Note,
        // also, the use of the -> operator to call the length() function on
        // each element, the same way you would use -> with a pointer.

        *i += "!!!";
        std::cout << "'" << *i << "' (length = " << i->length() << ")" << std::endl;

    // Types like "vector<string>::iterator" are quite a mouthful, and the
    // problem becomes more acute when you have more complex types, such as
    // "map<string, vector<unsigned int>>::const_iterator".  In C++11, the
    // "auto" keyword has been adapted to do what's called "type inference",
    // which asks the compiler to deduce (if possible) what the appropriate
    // type is without you having to write it.  Variables of "auto" types
    // still have a statically-determined type, just like variables whose
    // types you explicitly specify; the only difference is that you're asking
    // the compiler to use its knowledge of the program's declarations to
    // figure out the type for you, rather than you having to say it.  Given
    // that the compiler has still chosen a type for the variable, all the
    // same restrictions are in place once you have it -- you'll still have
    // to treat the variable like a variable of the chosen type.
    //
    // I don't find myself using "auto" very often, but for some patterns --
    // especially for something like the loop below, where there is enough
    // context for someone to be able to read and understand the code, including
    // knowing what its types are, without having to go searching through header
    // files to see how functions are declared.  So many containers have begin()
    // and end() functions that return iterators, there's no mystery here.
    //
    // Note, though, that whether you prefer "auto" or not, you should also
    // realize that you can't use it everywhere.  You can only use it in a
    // circumstance in which the compiler can deduce the correct type (e.g.,
    // when you're declaring a variable and immediately assigning it a value)
    // based on context.

// The keyword "const" has an effect on iterators.  Suppose we have a "const"
// vector, as in the parameter to printAll() below.  That means we've agreed
// not to do anything that might possibly change that vector.  This affects
// our ability to ask the vector for an iterator, since iterators possess the
// ability to not only access elements, but also to change them.
//
// The solution is to understand that when you ask a const container for an
// iterator, you get a special kind of iterator called a "const_iterator",
// which allows access to the individual elements in the container, but does
// not permit their modification.

    // This would be an error if we tried to do it:
    //
    // for (std::vector<int>::iterator i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); i++)

    // instead.

        //
        // *i = 3;
    }

    // Note, too, that "auto" will do the right thing here; it'll deduce that
    // the correct type of the iterator is std::vector<int>::const_iterator,
    // since the vector itself is marked "const".  In other words, if we've
    // promised not to change the vector, asking the vector for an iterator
    // will give us an iterator that provides that same promise.

// loop like the ones we've been writing.  The power is that they help you to

//
// As an example, there are many times where you wrtie a loop that boils down
// to "Do something to every element in a container."  This functionality is
// encapsulated in a generic algorithm called "for_each".  You tell the

// function to call on each element in that range of elements.  It does the
// rest.  The starting and ending positions are communicated as iterators.
