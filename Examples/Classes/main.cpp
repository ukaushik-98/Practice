    // This is how you declare a Song object statically.  Because its only
    // constructor requires two string parameters, it is *necessary* to
    // pass two strings to that constructor.
    //
    // Note that the word "new" is not being used here; that's because my 
    // goal is to allocate the object statically; "new" allocates objects
    // dynamically on the heap.  The advantage of static allocation is the
    // same here as it's been in other places: When you statically allocate
    // an object in a function, it will be destroyed automatically when the
    // function ends, removing the possibility of forgetting to destroy it
    // (which is a lot easier than you might think).
    //
    // Note, also, the use of the "initializer list" syntax that we saw
    // when we learned about structs; that same notation is the typical way
    // to initialize objects of classes, too, with the arguments you list
    // being passed to the class' constructor.  (There are some wrinkles
    // in this use of syntax, which we'll see later.)

    // Given a Song object, the '.' operator is used to call member functions,
    // the same way we used '.' to access the members of a struct.  When you
    // say "x.y", you're saying that "x" is an object with a member "y" and
    // that you want to access that "y" member.  If it's a member function, you
    // can call it; if it's a member variable (and you have access to it, i.e.,
    // it's not private), you can read from it or write to it.

    // As with a struct, when you have a pointer to an object of a class type,

    // access one of its members.  The ugly alternative, (*mySong).getArtist(),
    // is not something you'll typically see written.

    // Don't forget to delete the object when you're done with it!  It won't
    // always be the case that we delete objects in the same function in which
    // we create them dynamically -- in fact, it's much more often done
    // differently, because an object like this (whose lifetime matches the
    // lifetime of the function it's created in) would better be placed on
    // the stack, unless it's very large.
